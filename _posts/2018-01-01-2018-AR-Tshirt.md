💡 A fallout from my role as an advisor for a VR startup, I developped garments with virtual content. 

✌️ A web-based, standalone solution. Does not require you to install an app, or to even know a website address. 

💙 An excersie in shipping something small fast. Botched by receiving our Canadian visa, and hopping an ocean with 3 kids. 

💰 Value I brought to the project:
- UI/UX design
- Coding webVR
- End-to-end customer journey thinking 

👥 As an independent innovation consultant
