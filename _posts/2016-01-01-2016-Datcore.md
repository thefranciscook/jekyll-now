🏢 Datcore’s parent company is a software vendor specialized in custom data warehouse solutions for Hungary’s largest bank. 

⚡ They founded a spinoff start-up to *turn the custom solution into a product*. We designed a vision to guide their product roadmap and serve as a tangible sales tool to secure funding and clients. 

💡 As the product’s future users were hard to reach, we relied on gatekeepers, like the Datcore team’s business analysts and sales reps. Our process consisted of three main phases:

1. *Product strategy workshop*: UVP, business goals, user groups and needs, use cases, MVP scope, project roadmap
2. *MVP UX design*: IA, page flows, functional wireframes (Sketch, InVision), data visualizations, workshop between iterations
3. MVP UI design and brand identity 

✌️ Datcore was able to secure an initial investment, and operates successfully with 2.5Mio USD tunrover in 2017. 

💙 I thrive on complexity, and this product was definitely wasn't short of it. Luckily I had a great team to bounce off ideas with, to make sense of it and then to make it simple. 

💰 As a contracting Product Design Lead I worked in a five person team with another UX Lead, two UI designers and a branding expert.
