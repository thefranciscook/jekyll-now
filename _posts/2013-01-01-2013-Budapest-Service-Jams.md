🏢 One special weekend people interested in *service and customer experience* will meet at locations all over the globe. In a spirit of experimentation, innovation, co-operation and friendly competition, teams will have less than *48 hours to develop and prototype* completely new services inspired by a shared theme. 

⚡ Returning after my service design course in London, I connected with the local service designers (all 3 at that time), and as our first project we organized out first jam. 

💡 We *designed, organized and facilitated the jams*. Mentored participants to get the most out of the event. 

✌️ This event and its participants are *the root of today's thriving service design scene in Budapest*.

- Introduced service design and design thinking to the local startup scene
- 700+ followers on our Facebook page 
- 400+ members in our Service Design Budapest facebook group
- Next year our Ukrainian participant started up Kiev Service Jams 

💙 The thrill of startig some thing new and exciting. Teching people something I’m passionate about. 

💰 Value I brought to the project:

- Making it happen
- Service design experience
- Workshop design and facilitation
- Digital communication channels
