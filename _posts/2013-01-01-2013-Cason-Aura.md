üè¢ Cason Engineering plc. pioneered in industrial grade wireless communication technology, and provided automation and data acquisition solutions to the largest energy companies in the EMEA region.

‚ö° Cason‚Äôs R&D accidentally stumbled upon an *indoor tracking technology*. I pushed to make it into a product, and received the opportunity ad a product manager.

üí° Diwicon Aura was a *self-organizing wireless mesh network of sensors* listening to active RFID cards serving as beacons. This enabled real-time indoor location tracking and alarms.‚Ä®It was my role to find a matching market for the technology and develop it into a service producing a recurring revenue stream:

- *Evangelized prospects in the EMEA region* from various industries (productivity, industrial safety, education, health care)
- *Tested value propositions using prototypes*
- Developed pricing strategies, communication channels and new product versions to fit discovered needs
- *Delivered pilot projects*

‚úåÔ∏è Project highlights:

- Yacht tracking service realized (Croatia)
- Wander protection service (Hungary)

üíô My role required me to learn a lot and fast as I wore a multitude of hats:

- Evangelized prospects
- Communicated internally with involved departments and externally with partners and clients
- Managed software and hardware development, production and deployment
- Developed pricing
- Oversaw product communication and sales
- Reported to management and shareholders

üë• As a Product Manager at Cason Engineering plc.
