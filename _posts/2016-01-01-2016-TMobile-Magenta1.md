🏢 Deutsche Telekom (DT, T-Mobile’s parent co.) is Europe’s leading telecommunications provider (73,1 billion euros in revenue, 50 national companies, 60, customers) 

⚡ Deutsche Telekom set out to design an * omnichannel customer care experience* for a *new upmarket offering* launched in 7 countries across Europe. 

💡 The project team consisted of representatives from DT and the *directors of customer experience of the participating 7 countries*.

- We designed a *remote service design process* with in-person workshops at key points of the process.
- An initial scoping workshop mapped the customer journey stages and the areas of improvement (installation, first use, billing, cc, in-store experience).
- Remote research conducted by our team collected the best practices from the participating countries.
- We assembled a *unified ideal customer journey from the best practices*.
- We prepared a cookbook of practices to aid the national companies to implement the unified customer journey.
- New experimental *solutions were prototyped and evaluated at different countries*. 

✌️ The new premium care journey increased customer satisfaction by 22%. 

💰 Value I brought to the project:

- The ability to design and lead service design projects
- Consulting experience in large organizations
- Design research and prototyping expertise 

💙 My first take at leading an international service design project. Key takeaway: meeting in-person is so much more effective than remote collaboration, when it comes to strategic decision making.
