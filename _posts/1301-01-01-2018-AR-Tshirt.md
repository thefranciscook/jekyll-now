💡 A fallout from my role as an advisor for a VR startup, I developed *garments with virtual content*. 

✌️ A web-based, standalone solution. Does not require you to install an app, or to even know a website address. 

💙 *An exercise in shipping a product fast*.

💰 Value I brought to the project:

- UI/UX design
- Coding webVR
- End-to-end customer journey thinking 

👥 As an independent innovation consultant
