Dear Embassy of Canada,

I'm inquiring about the status of our Confirmation of Permanent Residence form (IMM-5688).

I've sent our required documents via a courier last Friday, and it was delivered on last Monday.

I attached the first page of our request letter for easier identification.


FAMILY COMPOSITION

There are no changes in my family composition, and none of my family members and me neither have been charged or convicted of a criminal offence.


MAILING ADDRESS

My mailing address, email address and contact information have not changed.

Mailing address: H-2030, Érd, Gyöngyvirág u. 66., Hungary


VISA

As Hungarian citizens we only need an eTA, and do not need a visa to travel to Canada.


RIGHT OF PERMANENT RESIDENCE FEE

I attached the receipt of the fees (receipt.pdf) I paid at the time of my online application: 
2.530$ = 490$ RPRF x 2 adults + 550$ processing fee x 2 adults + 150$ processing fee x 3 children

While I think I have paid all necessary fees, please let me know if I have any unpaid fees, as I'm happy to pay it anytime.

I've sent the printed photos and all the documents in this letter via a courier also.
