🏢 Deutsche Telekom (DT, T-Mobile’s parent co.) is Europe’s leading telecommunications provider (73,1 billion euros in revenue, 50 national companies, 60, customers) 

⚡ Deutsche Telekom approached us to advice them in the design of a wokrshop aimed at exploring the industry’s biggest growth dirver. 

💡 I designed and facilitated the workshop following a base journey approach, where we first mapped a journey based on the core value proposition, and later marked the parts specific for various customer segment. We relied on their expertise as customer advocates, as there was no budget for research. It was also my task to organize the logistics (venue, catering) the event required. 

✌️ The workshop served as an inspiration for a follow-up large scale project. 

💰 Value I brought to the project:

- Experience in facilitating international workshops
- Service design experience with T-Mobile 

💙 T-Mobile’s Directors were one of the most involved and engaged participants I have seen.
