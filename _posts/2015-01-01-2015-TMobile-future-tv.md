🏢 Deutsche Telekom is Europe’s leading telecommunications provider (T-Mobile’s parent company, 73,1 billion euros in revenue, 50 national companies, 60m customers) 

⚡ Deutsche Telekom approached us to advice them in the delivery of workshop about the future of thier TV offerings, with *Customer Experience Directors participating* from the national companies.

💡 I *co-designed and co-facilitated the workshop with DT's innovation team*. 

* We followed a base-journey approach, where we first mapped a journey based on the core value proposition, and later marked the parts specific for various customer segment. 
* We relied on the participants expertise as customer advocates, as there was no budget for research. 

✌️ The workshop served as an inspiration for a follow-up large scale project. 

💰 Value I brought to the project:

* Experience in facilitating international workshops
* Service design experience with T-Mobile 

💙 T-Mobile’s Directors were one of the most involved and engaged participants I have seen.
