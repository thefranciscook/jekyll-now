🏢 Hungarian Telekom (T-Mobile) serves millions of customers with integrated TV, phone, internet and mobile services. 

⚡ Isobar Budapest was in charge maintaining T-Mobile’s website.  

💡 The maintanence projects were *rapid design tasks with short deadlines*. Each tasks was assigned to one UX desinger, so these were *solo-projects* in essence. The typical process from my perspective looked like this:

- Scoping the project with the sponsor and the stakeholders
- *Budgeting, developing a proposal*
- *Managing the deadline, client correspondece*
- Desk research, and a little research (mostly friends of frinds, because of the lack of time)
- *Wireframing in Axure*
- As much usability testing as time allowed
- Presenting the design and iterating on it
- After acceptance, handing the design over to the UI and site build team
- Quality assurance during implementation 

✌️ Our fast process and team of veteran UX designers made sure that T-Mobile’s website was highly responsive to its business needs, with a world-class quality. 

💙 Nothing motivates me like making an impact does. My work reached millions of T-Mobile customers, including my firends and family. 

💰 Value I brought to the table:

- Years of UX experience, proficiency with the tools of trade
- Business bacground, from my past Product Manager role
- Confident use of the design process, stemming from my service design background
- Consulting skills like negotiation, client correspondence, stakeholder mapping
