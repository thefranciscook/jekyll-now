🏢 SuperDelivery.ai, a *team of veteran professionals with 10+ years experience* in the world of global finance / US startups / IoT product companies. 

⚡ The founders discovered a need, had a strong sense of a tech solution and needed *advice in developing it into a complete service concept*. 

💡 Together with the founders we designed a series of research activities, workshops, offsites and prototyping rounds to *validate the need and develop a shared vision*. 

✌️ Meeting with reality, the concept changed dramatically several times, and finally a strong shared vision emerged. This enabled the team to move forward with their patents and investor pitches. 

💰 Value I brought to the project:

- Experience in working with early-stage startups
- Being a partner for the founder, to have someone to bounce ideas off
- Familiarity with the tech involved (VR, AI) as an engineer
- Rapid prototyping / experimentation mentality from my service design experience
- Organizing offsites and workshops for the team to develop a shared vision 

💙 I loved the constant, rapid move from strategy to implementation and back. It was empowering to reconnect with my inner geek.
