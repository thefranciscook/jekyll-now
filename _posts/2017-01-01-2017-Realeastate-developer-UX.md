🏢 Our client was one of *the top 20 largest property developers* in Europe.

⚡ Our client's goal was to significantly *increase the number of online sales leads*. For this to happen the website needed to do justice to the quality of their apartments.

💡 Our process consisted of three main phases:

1. Strategy: workshops to map business goals, research to map user groups and needs
2. UX design: IA, page flows, functional and high-fi wireframes (Sketch, InVision), workshop between iterations
3. UI design and brand identity 

✌️ Our client was so satisifed with the results of the project and the opportunities we presented, that they decided to rebuild their website on a new platform to make those feasable.

💙 Real-estate development was a new domain for me. I enjoyed looking behind the curtains, and learn about their business.

💰 As a UX lead I did my fair share in desinging the actual flows and wiframes. In addition *my service design background* helped in two ways:

- *Facilitated workshops* made client and stakeholder correspondance a lot more effective, than sending email back-and-forth to reach an agreement.
- *Interviewing sales reps* provided insights on the balance of customer and business needs.
