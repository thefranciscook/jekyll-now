🏢 Hungarian Telekom (T-Mobile) serves millions of customers with integrated TV, phone, internet and mobile services. 

⚡ T-Mobile in the process of redefining its brand, was keen to explore how far is it from their customers’ day-to-day experience.
  
💡 We organized a *one day off-site*, where T-Mobile’s *directors took part in field research*, video screenings and interviews.  In the afternoon in groups they mapped their insights, customer pain points, and opportunities they discovered. 

✌️ During a final plenary session the participating directors formed *action committees to close  promise-experience gaps.*  The project’s insights were channeled into the wider brand development project. 

💰 Value I brought to the project:

- My previous service design projects with the client were a rich source of customer pain points to explore.
- I conducted some of the guerrilla research, which were screened during the event.
- I facilitated a team of directors throughout the day. Accompanying and coaching them during the field research sessions and facilitating the group synthesis workshops. 

💙 T-Mobile’s Directors were one of the most involved and engaged participants I have seen.
