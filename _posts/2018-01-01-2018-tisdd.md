🏢 ‘This is Service Design Doing ‘ is a sequel to ‘This is Service Design Thinking’ - a service design book with a huge following and impact. 

⚡ In 2017 I’ve got invited by Adam Lawrence to contribute to a chapter about workshop facilitation. 

✌️ Photos of our team’s work at Isobar and some of my comments on the different type of spaces a workshop might need made it to the book. 

💰 Value I brought to the project:
- Volunteerig to contribute
- My experience in service design involving workshop design and facilitation 

💙 As one who’s love of service design was ignited by ‘This is Service Design Doing’, having my fingerprint on its sequel is rewarding beyond words.
