🏢 Hungarian Telekom (T-Mobile) serves millions of customers with integrated TV, phone, internet and mobile services. 

⚡ *T-Mobile's web stores used a unified payment module.* While the stores supported mobile devices, the module was not responsive, hurting conversions.  

💡 The task was the *responsive redesign of the payment module*, supporting many different payment processes. 
It was a solo project, where *I was responsible for every aspect of the project* from budgeting, through client correspondence to the actual design work to be done:

- Project management: client correspondence, scoping, budgeting, time management
- Research: stakeholder mapping and interviews, mapping business and user needs, collecting use-cases and documenting UX specification
- UX Design: designing information architecture, page flows, functional wireframes (Axure)
- Implementation support: managing UI designer and site build contractors, functional specification for the client's implementation vendors

✌️ The module shipped on time. *As a result millions of customers could pay their orders and bills on their mobile.* 

💙 I loved the impact of my work: bill payment was among the redesigned payment transactions, affecting millions of customers - including my friends and family.

💰 Value I brought to the table:

- Years of UX experience, proficiency with the tools of trade
- Business background, from my past Product Manager role
- Confident use of the design process, stemming from my service design background
- Consulting skills, client correspondence, stakeholder mapping
