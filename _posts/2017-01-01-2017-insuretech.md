🏢 A French startup approached us to advise them in developing their insight into an insuretech product.

⚡ The elections in France posed an opportunity for a thematic MVP.

💡 We chose a classic lean cycle as a process:

1. Understand: concepting workshops, desk research, prospect and user interviews
2. Design: MVP scope with supported user journeys, functional wireframes, prototypes
3. Learn and refine: Test prototypes with followup interviews, measure and start the cycle again with the insights gained.

✌️ The results of the first cycle prompted the founders to pivot for another industry. The MVP is currently in development in France.

💙 I enjoyed the challenge of understanding a complex idea aimed to disrupt a complex industry.
