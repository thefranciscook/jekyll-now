🏢 A Hungarian top 10 e-commerce company (50k visits per day, €30K in revenue).

⚡ Our client needed to have its website redesigned, because of two strategic decisions:

- Once catering to a niche market, our client decided to introduce a wider range of offerings.
- They acquired an online magazine recently, which had to be integrated into their existing content strategy.

💡 -

1. Strategy
	- scoping
    - research planning
	- crunching CRM data (purchase history based segmentation)
	- contextual inquiries, 
	- quantitative research (GA, surveys, behaviour-based segmentation, Customer Effort Score, perception-based segmentation) to back up insights with data, 
	- qualitative followup (card sort, interviews, usability tests),  
	- customer journey mapping, 
	- esatblishing KPIs

2. Brand identity: brand strategy, look and feel, content marketing strategy
3. UX/UI: page flows, wireframes, UI designs, implementation support

✌️ The cross-examination of CRM-, behavioural- and perception-based segmentation painted a picture of  drastically different customer groups. To accomodate the needs of both, our client had to make some difficult choices. 
The new website will go live in April, 2018.
